# ARCTIC CODE
Arctic Code is a code puzzle game similar to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## What is Arctic Code?
In Arctic Code, you are presented with a scenario and given data that matches. You must write a short program that utilizes this data to get the desired output. The puzzles start off easy, then somewhat begin to increase in difficulty.

All of these puzzles are focused on the logic, so people with very little programming knowledge can still participate. No advanced knowledge of topics such as Maths or Physics are needed to participate. All resources required to complete the puzzles are provided, along with examples.

## How many questions are there?
As of yet there is only one question. Future questions that follow the storyline are to be added.
