            <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>

            <p>Five explorers have been selected to go on a voyage to the Arctic. Before they can leave, they must pack all of the gear required for their expedition to be deemed a success. The pilot has told everyone that they can bring a maximum of 120kgs each. If this value is exceeded, the plane will be too heavy to take off.</p>
            <p>All of the explorers have given the baggage handler a list(your puzzle input). This list contains the weights of each individual item that they have packed. If someones total luggage weight <span class="special">exceeds 120kgs</span>, the baggage handler will start to <span class="special">remove items</span> from the bags. They will begin with taking out the lighter items, then move up the list to heavier items. They will keep removing items until the weight is equal, or below 120kg.</p>
            <p>Find out how many items the baggage handler needs to remove for the plane to take off successfully.</p>

            <h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
            <p>Say that the data below is the baggage list that we are given by the baggage handler. For example purposes, the max weight is 15kgs and there are only 2 explores.</p>

                    <!-- First -->
                    <p>In this example, the total weight of the fist explorers items is <span class="special">16kg</span>, and the max weight is 15kg. We start removing the lowest number.</p>
                    <p><span class="special">16 - 1 = 15</span>, so we add <span class="special">1</span> to our removed items count.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <!-- Second -->
                    <p>In the second example, the total weight is <span class="special">28kg</span>. We start removing from the lowest number again until the weight is less than or equal to 20.</p>
                    <p><span class="special">28 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8 = 10</span>, so we add <span class="special">4</span> to the removed items counter.</p>
                    
                    <hr>

                    <!-- Answer -->
                    <p>Our answer is the total amount of items removed. <span class="special">1 + 4 = 5</span>, making our result <span class="special">5</span>.</p>
